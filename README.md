Project Analysis
1. Dataset Overview
This dataset represents the sales data of a company for a single financial year. It includes key information such as products, total sales, gross sales, countries where branches operate, customer segments, profit margins, and transaction dates. The data provides insights into which products generated the highest revenue, the geographical distribution of sales, and the performance of different market segments.

2. Key Insights and Trends
Product Performance:

From the column chart, it is evident that Paseo is the product with the highest profit, followed by VTT and Amarilla. On the other hand, Carettera earned the least profit.
Paseo also had the highest sales price, while Carettera recorded the lowest.
Country-Wise Sales:

The pie chart shows that the majority of sales were made in the United States, followed closely by Canada and France, with only small margins separating them. Mexico recorded the lowest sales.
Despite the differences, sales across all countries were relatively evenly distributed, indicating balanced performance in various regions.
Sales by Customer Segment:

A donut chart highlights that most sales were made to the government segment, followed by small businesses. Channel partners accounted for the least sales.
Sales Breakdown and Visual Enhancements:

A card displaying total sales is included for easy comparison when applying filters. A slicer with product categories allows users to filter the report and view detailed information about each product’s performance.
On the second page, a map visual is used to illustrate the geographical spread of the company’s sales, helping staff and employees visualize regional performance.
A bar chart showing monthly sales reveals that October was the peak month for sales, reaching nearly $3.5 million, while March saw the lowest sales, slightly above half a million.
A detailed table was added to summarize the total sales, cost of goods sold (COGS), gross sales, and profit for each product. The table also includes a drill-down feature to allow deeper exploration of specific data points.
Interactive Features:

Several slicers, buttons, and bookmarks have been incorporated to enhance navigation and the overall user experience, enabling more granular analysis of the data.
3. Business Recommendations
Focus marketing efforts on high-performing products like Paseo and VTT while exploring strategies to improve the profitability of Carettera.
Explore opportunities to increase sales in Mexico, which has the lowest sales volume compared to other countries.
Continue to target government and small business segments, as they represent the largest portion of the customer base, and consider developing strategies to engage channel partners more effectively.
